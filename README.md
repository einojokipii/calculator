# Calculator
Arithmetic expression calculator + parser.
[View demo](https://einojokipii.github.io/calculator/)

Inspired by google search calculator, I wanted to build my own simplified version of it, with a challenge of not using any libraries (or JS's eval function) for parsing / evaluation.

You can press the keys on your screen (UI), or actual keystrokes are registered too.

Pressing '=' (or enter on a keyboard) parses and evaluates the given expression with correct order of operations in mind.

Small bugs might occur :)
